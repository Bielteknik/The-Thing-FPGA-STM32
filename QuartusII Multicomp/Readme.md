"The Thing": Cyclone II FPGA + Arduino STM32F103C8T6 board, Multicomp compatible.

In this folder there are the Quartus II Multicomp projects for the Cyclone II FPGA. They could be paired with a given Arduino Sketch (.ino file) for the STM32 and with a given SD image for HD emulation.

To write the SD image into a SD card, unzip the image file and simply copy it to your SD card using the [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)
