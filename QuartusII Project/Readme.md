"The Thing": Cyclone II FPGA + Arduino STM32F103C8T6 board, Multicomp compatible.

In this folder there are the Quartus II projects examples for the Cyclone II FPGA. 
They are generally paired with a given Arduino Sketch (.ino file) for the STM32 (read the comments inside the project main source file).

* [Blink led example (H160119_Blink.qar)](https://github.com/SuperFabius/The-Thing-FPGA-STM32/blob/master/QuartusII%20Project/H160119_Blink.qar):
Blink the LED1 led on the board using the "Schematic editor" of Quartus II. No HDL language is required to understad it.
