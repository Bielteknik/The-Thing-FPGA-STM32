Two dev boards into one: a STM32 based Arduino ("Maple Mini" compatible) and a Cyclone II FPGA dev. board to start playing with VHDL/Verilog. It is also "Multicomp" compatible ("Multicomp" is a modular VHDL design to "run" some famous retro 8 bit CPUs made by Grant Searle) giving the option to "run" easily a VHDL SOC with a Z80/6809/6502 CPU and I/O, including HD (on SD) and a color VDU.
