"The Thing": Cyclone II FPGA + Arduino STM32F103C8T6 board, Multicomp compatible.

In this folder there are the SD images for HD emulation related to the Quartus II Multicomp projects for the Cyclone II FPGA. They are paired with a given Quartus II Multicomp project.

See in the [QuartusII Multicomp](https://github.com/SuperFabius/The-Thing-FPGA-STM32/tree/master/QuartusII%20Multicomp) directory to know which Quartus II Multicomp they belong to.

To write the SD image into a SD card, unzip the image file and simply copy it to your SD card using the [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)
