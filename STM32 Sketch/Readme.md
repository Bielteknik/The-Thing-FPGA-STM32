"The Thing": Cyclone II FPGA + Arduino STM32F103C8T6 board, Multicomp compatible.

In this folder there are the "sketch" examples (.ino files) for the STM32 Arduino. They are generally paired with a given Quartus II project example. See in the [QuartusII Project](https://github.com/SuperFabius/The-Thing-FPGA-STM32/tree/master/QuartusII%20Project) directory or read the comments inside the sketch source.
